"""check_controls.py -- control package member: the CI half of the
control check. Installed as
.githooks/check_controls.py; run by the kos-controls CI job.

CI cannot read the private governance repository, so this checks the
repository against the package manifest it carries
(.kos/controls-manifest.sha256, a byte copy of the release manifest):
.kos/controls.json pins the manifest's version, and every package member
the repository lists, plus the members a listed one requires (the
manifest's "# requires" lines), is present at its installed path with the
manifest sha256 (line endings normalized to LF). The check against the release
itself (required version, manifest equal to the release) runs locally in
pre-push (`kos_core.py controls check`) and in the drift scan.

Stdlib only. Exit 0 = OK; exit 1 = BLOCK (fail-closed on any doubt).
